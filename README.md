## Setup

- Arduino Uno or something comprable
- ArdaFruit Neopixel ring (24 RGB LEDS)
- Pot
- wire up power to everything
- Pixel ring data in goes to pin 6 on the board
- Pot goes to A5

Turn the pot and see the ring change. I'm using this to simulate (badly) a Tachometer. I'll run a line from one of the spark plugs or coils or something that has to do with the cylinder firing to get the signal I'm trying to represent.
